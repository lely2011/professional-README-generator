# Professional README Generator

## Description

- The motivation to this generator is create a professional style of a README for projects.
- This project is built to help create a professional and readable README file for all coding projects
- This solves users to remember all components needed in a README file by adding description, tablet of contents, installation, the use of application, credits, and license.
- I learned all of the components to create an acceptable README for future users to reference what the application does

## Installation

A started code was used to better organize the code sequence:
